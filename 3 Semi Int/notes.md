## Notes for lil semi-intermediate syntax and features:

(Vid 31 to 42)

- Vid 31: Inheritance

  - functions to be inherited must be marked virtual
  - use keyword 'override' while inheriting

- Vid 32: Multiple inheritance

  - while inhering multiple contracts, the order is important in which the contracts are inherited
  - little bit of tricky syntax, will get used to it

- Vid 33: Calling parent constructor
