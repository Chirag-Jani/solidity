## Notes for lil Basic++ syntax and features:

(Vid 19 to 30)

- Vid 19: Arrays

  - static and dynamic
  - static doesn't have push and pop functions
  - arrays in memory are fixed in size
  - don't return array in memory using funcs
    - as it uses more gas

- Vid 20: Remove element by shifting

  - not gas efficient
  - shift all the elements to one position right
  - pop the last elemnt
  - order of the elements is preserved

- Vid 21: Remove elemnt by replacing the last elemnt

  - gas efficient
  - order is not preserved
  - swap with the last element

- Vid 22: Mappings

  - 1D and 2D
  - key-value pairs

- Vid 23: Iterable Mappings

  - keep another mapping and the array
  - by the use of those two, one can iterate through the mapping

- Vid 24: Structs
